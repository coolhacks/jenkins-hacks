## What is jenkins ?
Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java. The project was forked from Hudson after a dispute with Oracle.
Jenkins provides continuous integration services for software development. It is a server-based system running in a servlet container
such as Apache Tomcat. It supports SCM tools including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, Clearcase and RTC,
and can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.
The primary developer of Jenkins is Kohsuke Kawaguchi.Released under the MIT License, Jenkins is free software.

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
